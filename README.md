## REMEDI Labs
### Connecting researchers and data providers

*REMEDI* platform is a virtual home for community of health professionals - nurses and pharmacists - working to improve patient safety at their hospitals. By sharing alerts and settings data from the "smart" medical devices in their care units, they get to see and analyze data from other hospitals and take informed data-driven decisions on how to adjust their technology and practices to make it safer for patients.
 
*REMEDI Labs* project aims to provide an interface for medical researchers to access collected data and offer a way for researchers to publish study results in the form of data-driven decision-support tools for the medical professionals to use in their daily work.

#### Background

The Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering (RCHE), an interdisciplinary research center, focused on improving healthcare delivery, located at Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN, developed an evidence-based community of practice for medical device informatics to promote and improve patient safety named the Regenstrief National Center for Medical Device Informatics (REMEDI).

REMEDI Central is the "go-to" site for medical device data, benchmarking, analysis, and research results for multiple medical devices, hundreds of hospitals, several medical device vendors, and a number of associations and organizations focused on improving healthcare delivery. Clinicians, primarily pharmacists and nurses, use REMEDI Central's analytics and reporting capabilities, and the knowledge of the collaborative to support hospital operations and improve patient safety.
